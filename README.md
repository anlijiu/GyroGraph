GyroGraph
=========

I've got an idea to create some Android application which would be something like "polish driver assistant". It reads the device's built-in gyroscope/accelerometer and GPS sensors and processes it into a colorful "road quality" map. Works very well (Galaxy Note II) but it's still just a prototype.
